File changed to include pretrained text decoder weights:
opts
train

All changes within these files are marked with # MODIFIED

Explanation:
ONLY SUPPORT Att2inModel

In opts.py, add new argument:
    parser.add_argument('--pretrain_rnn', type=str,
                    help='pretrained embedding weight and lstm weight from text autoencoder pretraining')

In train.py, load model.core weight, model.embed weight, model.logit weight. model.embed and model.logit are modified based on the repo's original wordtoix and ixtoword order.

Pretrained weights are stored in pretrained folder.
